First connect to the server using SSH, as this is easier because you can copy and paste

Now switch to the folder where the file is stored
cd /usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit

Next back up the file in case we mess things up
cp proxmoxlib.js proxmoxlib.js.bak

And then edit the file as we need to make a change
nano proxmoxlib.js

Use Ctrl-W to find and type in
if (res ==

Hit return and this should take you to a line like this
if (res === null || res === undefined || !res || res
                        .data.status.toLowerCase() !== 'active') {

Replace the line with this
if (false) {

Now save and exit using Ctrl-X

Basically we've changed this statement check to always return false so that it never triggers

Restart the PVE service for the changes to take effect
systemctl restart pveproxy

Now repeat this for all nodes

Logout of any existing session, close your browser, start the browser back up, connect to the server and you should find the subscription no longer appears
